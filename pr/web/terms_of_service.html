<h3>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h3>

<p>We provide our services using a privately reasonable level of skill and care,
and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that
we don't promise about our services.</p>

<p>OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER 
PHOBRAIN NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE 
SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN 
THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY,

<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY 
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO 
THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES. </p>

<h3>Liability for our services</h3>

<p>WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, PHOBRAIN, AND PHOBRAIN'S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, 
WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR

<p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF PHOBRAIN,
AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, 
INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID

or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from 
claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees. </p>

<h3>About these Terms</h3>

<p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a service
to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our services. You
should look at the terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to these 
terms on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become 
effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, 
changes addressing new functions for a service or changes made for legal 
reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified 
terms for a service, you should discontinue your use of that service. </p>

<p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the 
additional terms will control for that conflict. </p>

<p>These terms control the relationship between Phobrain and you.
They do not create any third party beneficiary rights. </p>

<p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away, 
this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as 
taking action in the future). </p>

<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not 
affect any other terms. </p>

<p>The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California's conflict of laws 
rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms 
or the services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the 
services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of 
San Francisco, California, USA, and you and Phobrain consent to personal
jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
