<p>We take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more 
about our privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Information we collect</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Information you give us.</b><br>
We collect your name and email, along with 
your comment, for the purpose of responding if we want to.</li>
<li><b>Information we get from your use of our services.</b><br>
We collect information about how you use our service, like how you respond to a
picture. This information includes:
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Browser and hardware</b></li>
    <li> <b>Log information</b><br>
         When you use our services, we automatically collect and store certain 
         information in <a href="server_log.html">server logs.</a> This includes:
         <ul>
          <li>Your responses to pictures.</li>
          <li>Intenet Protocol (IP) Address.<br>
              An IP address can often be used to identify the location from 
              which a device is connecting to the Internet. 
          </li>
          <li>Device information such as browser type, language, and timezone.</li>
         </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>


<h3>How we use information we collect</h3>

<p>We use the information we collect from our services to provide, maintain,
protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect us and our users.</p>

<h3>Sharing of information we collect</h3>

<p>We will share personal information with other companies, organizations or 
individuals if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or 
disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>
<ul>
    <li> meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
    <li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
    <li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
    <li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of ourselves, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will share non-personally identifiable information publicaly and with
our partners, such as other sites interested in our services. For example, we may 
share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.</p>
<p>If the site passes beyond current ownership, we will continue to ensure the 
confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before 
personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>

<h3>Information security</h3>

<p>All personally identifiable information is kept on a virtual server accessible
by only one person.</p>

<h3>Information retention</h3>

<p>This is an experimental web site. Information may be deleted when it is deemed
obsolete, when it is convenient, or when it cannot be kept under the conditions 
of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>When this Privacy Policy applies</h3>

<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all the services that we offer, including display
of pictures, gathering of responses, and collection of comments.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other organizations
or individuals, including sites that may provide a link to our site.</p>

<h3>Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities</h3>

<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. 
When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who 
made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, 
including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the 
transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly. </p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit 
consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes 
are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain 
services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior 
versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. </p>
